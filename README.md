# chess-project-java

My first project!
Entirely based on professor's code: https://github.com/acenelio/chess-system-java
Made using only Java and during the course Java COMPLETO 2023 Programação Orientada a Objetos +Projetos.
Didn't implement complex chess moves.

Play it executing the UI.java file on any terminal.
